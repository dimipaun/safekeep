# the base directory for data repository relative paths
base.dir = /var/lib/safekeep

# the default user under which the client will run
# client.user = root

# by default, be nice during backup
# you can control the server/client nice level via
# nice.adjustment.server and nice.adjustment.client
# or even on a per-client box in the .backup file.
# to disable nice, set it to 0
# nice.adjustment = 10
